Five months and somehow you still make my heart react like it’s the first time.
When I think about us, it doesn’t feel light.
It doesn’t feel casual.
It doesn’t feel like something temporary.
It feels deep.
It feels consuming.
It feels like something that changed me.
You didn’t just become my girlfriend.
You became a feeling I carry with me.
There are nights I lie down and replay moments with you, the way your eyes soften when you are tired, the way your voice drops when you are emotional,
the way your body relaxes when you are close to me.
You don’t even realise how much power you have over me in the smallest ways.
I crave you.
Not just physically, though God knows I do but emotionally, mentally, spiritually.
I crave your presence.
Your warmth.
The way your skin feels under my hands.
The way you look at me when you feel safe.
The way you melt into me when we are close.
There’s something about holding you that feels like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be and that’s not something I say lightly.
We have had our struggles.
We have had moments where it hurt.
Moments where we misunderstood each other.
Moments where we both felt vulnerable in ways that scared us but even in those moments,
even when we were frustrated,
even when we were tired, I never stopped wanting you and that says everything.
Because passion fades when it’s fake.
Desire fades when it’s surface level.
Attachment fades when it’s ego but what I feel for you hasn’t faded.
It’s gotten deeper.
More grounded.
More intentional.
More intense.
You are not just someone I love.
You are someone I want.
Over and over again.
I want your hands in mine.
I want your body against mine.
I want your head on my chest.
I want to feel your breath on my neck.
I want to look at you and know that you chose me just as fiercely as I chose you and vulnerability? Here is mine.
You matter to me in ways I don’t always say out loud.
Sometimes I act strong.
Sometimes I act calm.
Sometimes I pretend I don’t overthink but the truth is,
when you are happy, I feel it.
When you are hurting, I feel it.
When you pull away, I feel it.
When you choose me, I feel it deeply.
You have touched parts of me that I didn’t even know were reachable.
Five months ago, we were just two people talking.
Now you are woven into my days, my thoughts, my plans, my body, my emotions.
You are not temporary to me.
You are not casual to me.
You are not just someone.
You are mine.
I am yours.
On this Valentine’s Day,
I don’t just celebrate love.
I celebrate the way you make me feel alive.
Desired.
Grounded.
Connected.
I celebrate the way we have fought for each other.
The way we have stayed.
The way we have grown.
I promise you this 
I will keep choosing you.
With passion.
With intention.
With depth.
With desire.
With honesty.
Five months in and I still look at you like I’m discovering something rare.
I don’t take that lightly.

“I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours 
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours” - Drake 

Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.
Come closer.
Always.
